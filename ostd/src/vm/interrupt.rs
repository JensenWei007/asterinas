/// interrupt should be injected into the guest. If it commits an interrupt for
/// the next entry, it calls [`GuestInterruptPort::accept_interrupt`] so the

///
/// The implementation is supplied by the kernel. It may model a virtual
/// interrupt controller, or it may be a policy object that never offers
/// interrupts.

/// preemption or local interrupts. Implementations must not sleep, yield, or
/// wait on synchronization primitives that can block the current task.
